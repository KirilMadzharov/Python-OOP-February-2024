**Python-OOP-February-2024**

Throughout this course, I developed expertise in the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) using Python, focusing on creating complex and scalable software systems. I mastered working with classes and objects, implementing object-oriented modelling, and constructing efficient class hierarchies. Additionally, I delved into advanced programming concepts, including design patterns, the SOLID principles of software design, and the practical application of decorators and unit testing. Topics covered include comprehensive studies on abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and the importance of test-driven development (TDD).

**Overview of the topics covered in the course:**

**Classes and Objects:**

Gained a deep understanding of how to define and work with classes and objects, the backbone of OOP. Completed practical exercises to apply these concepts in real-world scenarios.

**Inheritance and Polymorphism:**

Mastered the concepts of inheritance and polymorphism, enabling the creation of flexible and maintainable code structures. Applied these principles through hands-on projects.

**Design Patterns:**

Explored various design patterns categorised into creational, structural, and behavioural patterns. Learned how to apply these patterns to solve common software design problems.

**SOLID Principles:**

Delved into the SOLID principles of software design, enhancing my ability to create robust, scalable, and maintainable object-oriented systems.

**Iterators and Generators:**

Acquired skills in implementing iterators and generators, crucial for efficient data handling and manipulation in Python.

**Decorators and Unit Testing:**

Advanced my understanding of decorators and their use cases, alongside mastering unit testing practices to ensure code reliability and functionality.

**Error Handling:**

Studied techniques for robust error handling, including the use of try-except blocks and the creation of custom exceptions to manage program flow and ensure stability.

**File Handling:**

Developed proficiency in file operations, learning to handle various file formats and data structures with Python, enhancing my data processing capabilities.

**Modules:**

Gained insights into modular programming by creating and utilising Python modules, promoting code reuse and organisation.

**Exam Preparation:**

Engaged in thorough preparation for the course's final assessment, reinforcing my knowledge and skills through exercises designed to mirror exam conditions.
