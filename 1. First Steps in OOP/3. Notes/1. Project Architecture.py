"""
SPLITTING THE CODE INTO LOGICAL PARTS
"""

# We use methods to split code into functional blocks:

# ▪ Improves code readability
# ▪ Allows for easier debugging

# A single function should operate a single task:

# for move in moves:
# def move_enemies()
# def killer_check()
# def move_player(move)
