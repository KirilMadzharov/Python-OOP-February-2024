"""ENCAPSULATION DEFINITION"""

"What is Encapsulation"

# Packing of data and functions into a single component

# Allows us to put restrictions and can prevent the
# accidental modification of data

# To do that, an object’s variable can only be
# changed by an object’s method


"Encapsulation in Python"

# Everything written within the Python class
# (methods and variables) are public by default

# However, Python implements weak encapsulation.
# This means it is performed by convention rather than being enforced by
# the language


"Access Modifiers"

# How to control access?

# ▪ Using a single underscore
# ▪ Using double underscore (making it "private")
# ▪ Using getter and setter methods to access private variables
# ▪ It is a matter of convention to differentiate them into three terms – public,
# protected, and private
